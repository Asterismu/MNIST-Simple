# MNIST Simple App

#Overview

The MNIST Example App is a simple machine learning application that can recognize handwritten digits. It uses a pre-trained model on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits.

- #Features

- Digit Recognition: Recognize and predict digits from 0 to 9 using a pre-trained neural network model.
- User Interface: Simple and intuitive UI for easy interaction with the application.
- Real-time Prediction: Instantly predicts the digit when an image is provided to the app.

#Installation
ï¼ˆthis app includes a tkinter interface, please run this on a device with graphics)
